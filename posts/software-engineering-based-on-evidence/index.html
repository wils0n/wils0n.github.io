        <p>Software Engineering based on evidence or evidence-based on software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the International Conference on Software Engineering by Kitchenham et. al. It is a means for decision making due to the increasing use of software in everyday life. Although software-based systems are generating great economic and social benefits, they can also represent a great threat to industry, society and people.[1]</p>
<p>The principal objective of EBSE is to identify the gap that exists between the research and the practice of software engineering (ES). For that, we need evidence of research to build a body of knowledge about when, how and which process, technologies, tools and others are adequate to use in the ES and it can provide the mechanisms needed to assist practitioners to adopt appropriate technologies and to avoid inappropriate technologies[1].</p>
<p>In this background, the main tool for summarizing the evidence is the Systematic Review of Literature (SRL). The SRL uses rigorous validation, reliable and auditable. Unlike traditional review or informal review of literature, the SRL is based on a protocol to avoid vices. These vices can be influenced by the personal interests of researchers in question formulations, collected, validation and interpretation of data.[2][3]</p>
<p>The informal review of literature is unreliable, not reproducible, incomprehensible and the  quality depends on research experience which has a lack of scientific rigor. Nevertheless, the RSL has a controlled and rigorous process, to help the software industry  make decisions related to the effectiveness and efficiency of specific methods or technologies, in certain circumstances, and to assist the researchers in the identification of gaps in the actual investigation that can suggest new topics to research [2][3].</p>
