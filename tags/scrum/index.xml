      <description>The daily scrum meetings are not reported events of tasks, status or to answer the 3 questions (what I did yesterday, what I do today and if I have any impediments), they are meetings to identify impediments and produce actionable plans for that day&amp;rsquo;s work. The daily scrum meetings are not to resolve problems, but to promote quick decision-making. The daily scrum meeting should not exceed the 15 minutes of duration.</description>
