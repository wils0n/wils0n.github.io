      <description>My name is Wilson Julca Mejía and I’m a Software Engineer with 7 years of experience of which I have been working as a Backend Developer with Python and the last 4 years as an IOS developer with Swift and Objective-C. I have worked with many clients of banking, assurance, telecommunications, logistics and e-commerce.
I’m volunteering in a study group of my Faculty at San Marcos University teaching students about algorithms for competitive programming, because I like algorithms and I have participated in the International Competitive Programming Contest (ACM ICPC) as a competitor and as a coach for many years.</description>
